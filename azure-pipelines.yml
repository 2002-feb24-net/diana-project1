# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml
# This file defines a set of jobs that will run when triggered on a cloned version of your repo.
# A job is a set of steps
# By default, there's one job, and you give it the list of steps

# By default, all branches will get built.
# Adding a trigger configuration says "only build a master branch"

trigger:
- master

# A pool is a set of machines for running this job.
# This configuration says: "use Microsoft's hosted Ubuntu Linux virtual machines"
# We could have it connect to a machine we control to run the job on

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

# the steps in the job
# "script" is one kind of step on linux, it will run on bash
# On windows, it'll run in command prompt
# Give all steps a good display name

steps:
- script: echo Hello, world!
  displayName: Print hello world

- script: |
    echo "Showing current directory contents"
    ls
  displayName: Show directory contents
